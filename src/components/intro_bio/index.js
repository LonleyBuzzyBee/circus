               <p>Hi, I’m Mai — though better known by my stage name, Des. I’m a multidisciplinary aerialist and performer based in NYC, originally from Portland, Oregon, with a creative chapter that unfolded in Seattle before making my way to New York.</p>
               <br/>
               <p>I started with pole over seven years ago and fell in love with aerial and other stage performance about four years ago. Since then, I’ve expanded into lyra, contortion/acrobatics, and gogo — finding inspiration in movement that merges strength, sensuality, and storytelling.
                  </p>
                  <br/>
               <p>I began performing in nightclubs and have since brought my work to private events across the country. Whether I’m suspended in the air or grounded in connection with an audience, I try to create moments that feel both raw and magnetic.</p>
